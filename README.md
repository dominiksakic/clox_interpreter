# clox_interpreter

source: https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html

- Goal: use the language design from crafting interpreters, but working from my own skills.

- First hurdle:
  - 1. create program that can print out txt file. (CLEAR, learned about c programm structure of header files, makefile)
  - 2. print out txt that the user insert into cmd. (CLEAR)

Common mistakes: trying to assign a char to a char*; loosing sight of what I used where, because there is so many files: header, c, and then trying to make everything modular... .

- Second hurdle:
  - How do I create objects? 
  - How can I save a vague type to the same memory address? Like how can one MEM address hold a number or a string?

Common mistake: again trying to assing a char to a char*; Circular include; using '' instead  "".
